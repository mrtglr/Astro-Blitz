# Astro Blitz ðŸš€

Astro Blitz is an exhilarating 3D Unity game developed with version 2018.4.7f1, featuring intense space battles scripted in C#. University Game Programming course project.

## Gameplay ðŸŽ®

In Astro Blitz, players take control of a powerful spaceship tasked with defending against enemy spaceships from another dimension. Maneuver skillfully to avoid deadly asteroids while unleashing a barrage of shots to obliterate both asteroids and enemy spaceships. Earn points for every successful hit: 10 points for asteroids, 30 points for enemy spaceships. However, letting an enemy spaceship slip through deducts 10 points from your score.

## Increasing Challenges ðŸŽ–

As you rack up points, brace yourself for escalating challenges. Encounter increasingly formidable waves of enemies and hazardous asteroids every 100 points. The background speed also intensifies with time played, ensuring a dynamic and challenging gaming experience.

## Core Heat Feature

To add an extra layer of challenge, Astro Blitz introduces the Core Heat feature. Each shot fired increases the core heat by 10 points. Failure to shoot for 2 seconds decreases core heat by 10 points. If the core heat reaches 100, a cooldown is triggered, preventing the player from shooting until it returns to zero, a process taking 5 seconds. This strategic element adds a level of skill and timing to the game, preventing mindless spamming of lasers.

## Shields and Power-ups

Survival in Astro Blitz requires strategic use of shields and power-ups. Players can gain a temporary shield by grabbing a shield orb during combat. Activate the shield for 5 seconds, during which you become impervious to damage from asteroids and enemy spaceships.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Unity version 2018.4.7f1 installed.
